# 4. Solution Strategy

This section outlines the fundamental decisions and solution strategies that shape the architecture of the MCreport application.

## 4.1 Technology Decisions

| Technology | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Single HTML File | Simplifies deployment and distribution; no build process required |
| Vanilla JavaScript | Avoids framework dependencies, making the application lightweight and easy to maintain |
| CDN-hosted Libraries | Reduces the need for local dependencies and simplifies updates |
| Client-side Processing | Enables the application to run without a backend, simplifying deployment |
| Browser LocalStorage | Provides simple persistence without requiring a database |

## 4.2 Key Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Description | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Single-page Application | The entire application runs in a single HTML page | Simplifies deployment and provides a seamless user experience |
| Direct Jira API Integration | The application communicates directly with Jira's REST API from the browser | Eliminates the need for a backend proxy, simplifying the architecture |
| Monte Carlo Simulation | Uses Monte Carlo methods for forecasting epic completion | Provides probabilistic forecasts that account for variability in velocity |
| Client-side PDF Generation | Uses jsPDF and html2canvas for PDF export | Allows for report generation without server-side processing |
| Responsive Design | Uses CSS media queries for mobile compatibility | Ensures the application is usable on different devices |

## 4.3 Quality Goals and Solution Approaches

| Quality Goal | Solution Approach |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Usability | Clean, intuitive UI with clear visual indicators for status and forecasts |
| Performance | Efficient JavaScript implementation of Monte Carlo simulations; pagination for large data sets |
| Reliability | Error handling for API calls; fallback mechanisms for velocity data |
| Portability | Browser-based implementation with responsive design; minimal dependencies |

## 4.4 Organizational Decisions

| Decision | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Minimal Documentation | Code is self-documenting with clear function names and comments |
| Single Codebase | All functionality is contained in a single HTML file for simplicity |
| Direct Browser Execution | No build or compilation step required |
