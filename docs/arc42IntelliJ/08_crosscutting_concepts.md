# 8. Cross-cutting Concepts

This section describes the overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts of the MCreport system.

## 8.1 User Interface

### 8.1.1 Structure and Layout

The MCreport application follows a clean, card-based layout with a consistent visual hierarchy:

- Main container with rounded corners and subtle shadow
- Section headers with clear visual separation
- Card-based layout for epic summaries
- Consistent use of spacing and typography
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

### 8.1.2 Visual Design Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Color Coding | Consistent color scheme for status indicators (green for done, yellow for in progress, red for blocked, blue for open) |
| Status Pills | Rounded pill-shaped indicators for status counts with consistent colors |
| Progress Bars | Visual representation of allocation percentages |
| Cards | Boxed content areas with subtle shadows and rounded corners |
| Typography | Consistent font usage (Inter) with clear hierarchy of sizes and weights |

### 8.1.3 Interaction Design

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Progressive Disclosure | Details are initially hidden and can be expanded by the user |
| Immediate Feedback | Status updates and calculations are displayed immediately after user actions |
| Filtering | Multiple filter options for customizing the view |
| Direct Manipulation | Editable fields for velocity values and target sprints |

## 8.2 Data Management

### 8.2.1 Data Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Jira REST API | Primary source for sprint, epic, and story data |
| Jira Greenhopper API | Source for velocity data |
| User Input | Velocity adjustments and target sprint settings |
| LocalStorage | Persistence of historical data between sessions |

### 8.2.2 Data Processing

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Data Transformation | Converting raw Jira data into application-specific structures |
| Filtering | Client-side filtering of stories by status and team |
| Aggregation | Calculating summary statistics for epics and stories |
| Historical Tracking | Storing and comparing data across sessions to track changes |

## 8.3 Monte Carlo Simulation

### 8.3.1 Simulation Approach

The application uses Monte Carlo simulation to forecast epic completion:

1. Historical velocity data is used as the basis for the simulation
2. Random sampling from historical data accounts for variability
3. Multiple simulation runs (thousands) provide statistical confidence
4. Results are analyzed at different confidence levels (50%, 75%, 95%)

### 8.3.2 Allocation Analysis

The application calculates required resource allocation:

1. For each epic, the application determines the allocation needed to complete within a target timeframe
2. This is calculated at different confidence levels
3. The sum of required allocations is compared to total capacity (100%)
4. Warnings are displayed if allocations exceed capacity

## 8.4 Error Handling

### 8.4.1 API Error Handling

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Graceful Degradation | Fallback mechanisms when primary API calls fail |
| User Feedback | Clear error messages when API calls fail |
| Authentication Prompts | Directing users to log in when authentication issues occur |
| Retry Logic | Alternative data fetching approaches when primary methods fail |

### 8.4.2 Data Validation

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Input Validation | Ensuring numeric inputs are valid |
| Data Completeness Checks | Checking for sufficient data before performing calculations |
| Fallbacks | Default values when expected data is missing |

## 8.5 Performance Optimization

### 8.5.1 Client-side Processing

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Efficient Algorithms | Optimized Monte Carlo simulation implementation |
| Pagination | Fetching large datasets in chunks |
| Lazy Loading | Loading details only when requested by the user |
| Caching | Storing and reusing results when inputs haven't changed |

### 8.5.2 Resource Management

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| CDN Usage | Loading libraries from CDNs to leverage caching |
| Minimal Dependencies | Using only necessary external libraries |
| Single File | Combining all code into a single file to minimize HTTP requests |

## 8.6 Security Concepts

### 8.6.1 Authentication

The application relies on the user's existing Jira authentication:

1. No credentials are stored in the application
2. API calls use the user's browser session for authentication
3. Users must be logged into Jira in the same browser

### 8.6.2 Data Privacy

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Client-side Only | No data is sent to any server other than Jira |
| LocalStorage | Historical data is stored only in the user's browser |
| No Tracking | No analytics or tracking code is included |
