# 11. Risks and Technical Debt

This section documents the known risks and technical debt in the MCreport system.

## 11.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Jira API Changes | Jira may change their API structure or authentication mechanisms | Application could stop functioning correctly | Monitor Jira API changes and update the application accordingly; implement version checking |
| CORS Limitations | Browser security policies may prevent direct API calls to Jira | Users may be unable to fetch data | Ensure users are logged into Jira in the same browser; consider adding instructions for CORS issues |
| Browser Compatibility | Different browsers may interpret JavaScript or render CSS differently | Inconsistent user experience across browsers | Test regularly across major browsers; use standard web technologies |
| CDN Availability | External libraries loaded from CDNs may become unavailable | Features dependent on these libraries would fail | Consider bundling critical libraries with the application |
| LocalStorage Limitations | Browser LocalStorage has size limitations and can be cleared by users | Historical data could be lost | Add export/import functionality for historical data; warn users before clearing data |

## 11.2 Organizational Risks

| Risk | Description | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Single Developer Dependency | The application appears to be maintained by a single developer or small team | Knowledge loss if developer leaves; limited resources for enhancements | Improve documentation; consider open-sourcing or expanding the development team |
| Jira Authentication | The application relies on users being authenticated with Jira | Users without proper Jira access cannot use the application | Provide clear instructions on Jira authentication requirements |
| User Training | Users may not understand Monte Carlo simulation concepts | Misinterpretation of forecasts and probabilities | Add explanatory tooltips and documentation about statistical concepts |
| Stakeholder Expectations | Stakeholders may treat probabilistic forecasts as commitments | Unrealistic expectations and potential disappointment | Clearly communicate the nature of probabilistic forecasts in reports |

## 11.3 Technical Debt

| Debt | Description | Impact | Remediation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Single File Structure | All code is in a single HTML file | Difficult to maintain and extend; challenging for collaboration | Refactor into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with proper modularization |
| Inline Styling | Some styling is defined inline rather than in the CSS section | Inconsistent styling; difficult to maintain | Move all styling to the CSS section with proper classes |
| Global Variables | Extensive use of global variables | Potential for naming conflicts; difficult to debug | Refactor to use modules or namespaces |
| Limited Error Handling | Basic error handling with alerts and console logs | Poor user experience when errors occur | Implement more robust error handling with user-friendly messages |
| Minimal Comments | Limited code comments in complex sections | Difficult for new developers to understand the code | Add comprehensive comments, especially for the Monte Carlo simulation logic |
| No Automated Tests | Lack of unit or integration tests | Difficult to verify changes don't break existing functionality | Implement automated testing for critical functions |
| Hard-coded Values | Some values are hard-coded rather than configurable | Limited flexibility for different use cases | Extract configuration options to a settings object |
| Direct DOM Manipulation | Direct DOM manipulation rather than using a framework | More complex code; potential for DOM-related bugs | Consider adopting a lightweight framework for UI management |

## 11.4 Improvement Opportunities

| Opportunity | Description | Benefit |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Modularization | Refactor the code into modules with clear responsibilities | Improved maintainability and extensibility |
| Build Process | Implement a build process with bundling and minification | Reduced file size; better organization; dependency management |
| Offline Support | Add service worker for offline functionality | Application would work without internet connection |
| Data Export/Import | Add functionality to export and import data | Better data persistence; sharing capabilities |
| Configuration Options | Make simulation parameters configurable | More flexibility for different teams and projects |
| Visualization Enhancements | Add charts and graphs for velocity trends and forecasts | Better visual representation of data for stakeholders |
| API Abstraction Layer | Create an abstraction layer for Jira API calls | Easier to adapt to API changes; potential for supporting other tools |
| Automated Testing | Implement unit and integration tests | Improved reliability and easier maintenance |

## 11.5 Risk and Debt Management Strategy

To address the identified risks and technical debt, the following strategy is recommended:

1. **Prioritization**: Focus first on risks and debt that directly impact user experience or data integrity
2. **Incremental Improvement**: Address technical debt incrementally rather than attempting a complete rewrite
3. **Documentation**: Improve documentation to mitigate knowledge loss risks
4. **Testing**: Implement automated testing for critical functionality
5. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor Jira API changes and browser compatibility issues
6. **User Education**: Provide clear guidance on statistical concepts and application usage
7. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a mechanism for users to report issues and suggest improvements
